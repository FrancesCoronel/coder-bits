Initialize the two variables a and b with the values 14 and 5. 

When I say initialize, I basically mean you need to make sure that a is recognized as 14 by declaring it as a = 14 and the same with b so b = 5.

Now go ahead and print these following messages:

a) a
b) b
c) a+b
d) a - b 
e) a * b 
f) a ** b
g) a / b
h) a // b
i) a % b

"""

a = 14
b = 5

print ("a)" , a)
print ("b)" , b)
print ("c)" , a + b)
print ("d)" , a - b)
print ("e)" , a * b)
print ("f)" , a ** b)
print ("g)" , a / b)
print ("h)" , a // b)
print ("i)" , a % b)
